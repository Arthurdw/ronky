## In memory of Ronky

In loving memory of my dear cat Ronky, named for his unique habit of spinning
with a loud sound _(to "ronk" in Dutch)_. Ronky lived to the age of 14 and bravely
endured acromegaly. This condition resulted in the abnormal growth of his tissues
and bones.

He passed away peacefully, surrounded by those who loved him. He will be deeply missed.

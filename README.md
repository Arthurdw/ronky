# Ronky - A simple way to export Rust definitions

[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ronky)](https://crates.io/crates/ronky)

This library allows you to extract Rust types and serialize them into
[Arri](https://github.com/modiimedia/arri) types.

> ðŸš§ This is still under development, features such as object serialisation and
> de serialisation will be coming soon. ðŸš§

## Feature(s) that will never be implemented

- Empty schema form, this is something that should never be used in Rust code
  anyway and is greatly a sign of bad code and a common source for bugs.

## Example Usage

You can find examples in the `./examples/` directory.

## In memory of Ronky

In loving memory of my dear cat Ronky, named for his unique habit of spinning
very loud _(to "ronk" in Dutch)_. Ronky lived to the age of 14 and bravely
endured acromegaly.

He passed away peacefully, surrounded by those who loved him. He will be deeply missed.
